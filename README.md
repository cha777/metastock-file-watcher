# MetaStock file watcher

This simple tool can be used to identify MetaStock DAT/MWD file changes.
Once a change is triggered, it will output the last OHLC record and the number of OHLC records of the changed file

This tool was used by me @ DirectFN to determine the time delay for AmiBroker MetaStock link to get update on file change.

## Getting started

Update `directoryToWatch` with the required folder to watch (probably the meta-stock db folder)
